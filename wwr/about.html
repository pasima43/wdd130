            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>White Water Rafting Company was founded in 2010 by a group of passionate outdoor enthusiasts who wanted
                to
                share their love for river adventures with others. Starting with just a few rafts and a vision for
                safe, memorable experiences, the company quickly grew as word spread about their commitment to
                customer satisfaction and environmental stewardship. Over the years, White Water Rafting Company has
                expanded its offerings, trained expert guides, and built a reputation for delivering thrilling
                rafting trips on some of the region's most scenic waterways. Today, we continue to inspire adventure
                and connection with nature for families, friends, and solo explorers alike. Join us as we create
                unforgettable memories on the water!</p>
