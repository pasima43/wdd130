            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Founded in 2005 by Nigerian adventurer Paschal Ezenwa,Rafting rapid Adventure began with humble trips
                on the Ogun
                River.
                Inspired by local fishermen's skills,Paschal pioneered eco-friendly rafting. Early expeditions focused
                on
                Cross River's rapids, blending thrill with cultural immersion. By 2010, they expanded to Benue River,
                emphasizing
                conservation. Today,Rapids Adventures is a leading rafting outfitter, known for expert guides, safety,
                and showcasing Nigeria's waterway beauty. Partnerships with local communities boost eco-tourism, making
                adventure
                accessible while preserving aquatic's heritage and environment for future generations to enjoy
                and explore.
